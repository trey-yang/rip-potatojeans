            <p>Hello! My name is Trey. People also know me as 杨清云 or Qingyun Yang.</p>
            <p><a class="SMButton" href="/resume-en-latest" target="_blank">résumé</a> <u><a class="SMButton"

            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>I graduated from <a href="https://www.bu.edu/" target="_blank">Boston University</a> with a B.A. in
                <b>Astronomy and Physics</b>. I am starting in the Master's program in Astronomy and Astrophysics at <a
                    href="https://www.anu.edu.au/" target="_blank">Australian National University</a> in 2023.
            </p>
            <p>My <b>hometown</b> is a small city in the south-western mountains of China, called <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guiyang" target="_blank">Guiyang</a>. Ever since I came back in
                2020 due to COVID-19 I have been exploring and re-discovering this part of China, particularly the
                surrounding nature and spicy food - often accompanied by many of the wonderful people here.
            </p>
            <p>I play the <b>saxophone</b> pretty well. Right now I'm saving up for an EWI, while also trying to learn
                the guitar as well as electronic music production. I hope you'll be able to listen to my creations one
                day.
            </p>
            <p>I am a licensed <b>ham radio</b> operator (call sign KC1GFQ) in the United States. I am interested in
                radio telemetry, APRS, and emergency communications.
            </p>
            <p>I am also starting to offer bespoke <b>website designs</b> to artists and creators I like, so if I told
                you about it and asked you to check out this website, well, that'd be why :)
